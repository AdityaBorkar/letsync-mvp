TODO - Write a README for the Developer

## Local Development

- To use in your local package (Bun)
  - Run: `cd ../path-to-application-folder/node_modules/react && bun link`
  - Run: `bun link react` (Make sure react is not mentioned in the package.json)
NOTE - I have done the same with react-dom as well, Idk if it's needed.
NOTE - Bun uses symlinks to link packages from global cache.
